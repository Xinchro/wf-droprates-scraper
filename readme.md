This was a 1-man private repo until very recently, so please bear with me, for now, about any oddities found (libraries being used but not in dependencies, etc.).

# Warframe droprate data scraper and searcher

## What?

### Summary

I should preface this by saying that while 
[Digital Extremes](http://www.digitalextremes.com/) provides the data I use, they are not affiliated at all with this project.

This is a "2 part" repo, it contains both server and client code, currently. It will be split into 2 repos at some point but for now this works.

The goal was (and is) to give users a quick and easy way to find the drop rates for specific items/rewards, which are provided by 
[Digital Extremes](http://www.digitalextremes.com/).

There's also a [Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/Xinchro/wf-droprates-scraper), if you want to track coming features/updates.  
Backburner items are ideas/features that would be fairly large to massive timesinks for what they actually add, so they hang out in the backburner until they rise in importance or I come up with a quick, alternate, solution.

#### Scraper

The scraper runs on AWS Lambda at midnight UTC every day.  
It reads the [Warframe droprate page](https://n8k6e2y6.ssl.hwcdn.net/repos/hnfvc0o3jnfvc873njb03enrf56.html), parses the DOM, looking at the different sections, subsections and table data, separates it out and transforms it into usable JSON. After the entire page has been read and turned into JSON, it takes the different JSON files (1 file per section) and uploads it to a bucket on AWS S3.  
If anything fails, as it did when some sections where modified in the past, an email is sent to me telling me to **`go fix it`**.

#### Searcher

The searcher is built on VueJS and a few Vue plugins, such as the infinite scroll. It allows a user to filter and search through the JSON files generated by the scraper via a few buttons(filters) and a search box. I've used a query string approach to allow the search(es) to be shared or bookmarked. It also saves some preferences (last search included) to localstorage, for a better return experience.

## Why?

Initially it was just a clunky, very ugly, wrapper/searcher of the droprate page for myself. I showed it to a few fellow Warframe players and they liked the general prospect, so I fleshed it out.  
And here we are.

## How?

### Tech

#### Front:
 - VueJS
  - and plugins
 - SASS, mmmm SASS
 - Font-Awesome, for the few icons I use, could probably just have those specific few ones and not load the whole library
 - NPM scripts are the glue that makes everything run on the dev side
 - Web workers, to deal with the search and making it run on not-the-main-thread

#### Back:
 - NodeJS, does all the scraping and JSONing
 - AWS Lambda, runs daily to keep data up-to-date
 - AWS Cloudwatch CRON expression, to run the Lambda at midnight daily
 - AWS S3 buckets, to host the data and website files
 - CloudFlare, to provide HTTPS and pretty good caching

### Contributing

I'm not _looking_ for any contributions, but I'm open to PRs anyone may have.  
Just try stick to the style already present. I started off learning the [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), so giving that a read and then playing by ear is probably the best way to go about it.
